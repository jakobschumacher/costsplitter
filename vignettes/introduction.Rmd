# Aim 
Divide the costs of a group undertaking. If you go hiking with your friends the whole group has some costs that need to be divided. If you always share evenly the division can be unfair. What if somebody had to leave early? What if somebody only participated in some activities? What if somebody booked a seat but couldnt show up? What if there is a person who earns less and others would like to chip in? What if there were children who eat less than a full grown adult? This R package tries to balance these problems to have a fair distribution. Friendship is great and all the accounting should be smooth and unproblematic. 



# Function: Read in data
The trick for a smooth and easy division of costs lies with they way the costs and the amount that people already paid are written down. 

## The _participants.csv_ file
Columns in the CSV File

    prename: This column contains the first name of each person.
        Example: "James", "Olivia"

    surname: This column contains the last name of each person.
        Example: "Smith", "Johnson"

    group: This column represents the group that the person belongs to. It often matches the surname, which can imply that the group is a family or has some other common attribute.
        Example: "Smith", "Johnson"

    agegroup: This column shows whether the person is an adult or a kid. This helps categorize individuals based on their age for analysis.
        Possible values: "adult", "kid"

    age: This column contains the actual age of the person if available. Some rows may have missing values, which means the age was not recorded.
        Example: "23", "14"

    cost_dinnerday1: This column records the cost status for dinner on the first day. It has categories such as "full" or "reduced" to indicate the amount paid for dinner.
        Possible values: "full", "reduced", or empty (meaning no dinner was recorded)

    cost_day1, cost_day2, cost_day3: These columns indicate the cost status for each individual on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3, respectively. The values can be "full" or "reduced", indicating whether the individual paid the full cost or a reduced rate.
        Possible values: "full", "reduced", or empty

    adjustment: This column shows if there was any adjustment made to the person's costs. It indicates if they received a discount or had some cost reduction on any day.
        Possible values: "less" or empty (if no adjustment was made)


```{r examples-read_data}
df <- read_data(path = system.file("participants.csv", package = "Grouptraveller"))

```




# Helper functions
We need some helper functions along the way.

## Function to change the categorical values to numerical values 
In the cost variables we accept categorical values. 


```{r examples-change_categorical_to_numeric}
df <- change_categorical_to_numeric()
```





# Get stats

```{r examples-get_stats}
get_stats(read_data())

```




```{r example-divide_costs}
df <- divide_costs()
```
