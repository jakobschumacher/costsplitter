# What's this package about? 
Divide the costs of a group undertaking. If you go hiking with your friends the whole group has some costs that need to be divided. If you always share evenly the division can be unfair. What if somebody had to leave early? What if somebody only participated in some activities? What if somebody booked a seat but couldnt show up? What if there is a person who earns less and others would like to chip in? What if there were children who eat less than a full grown adult? This R package tries to balance these problems to have a fair distribution. Friendship is great and all the accounting should be smooth and unproblematic. 

# How to use this package?

## Install and load the package
The package uses R. The package can be installed using devtools with this function call `devtools::install_github(github.com/jakobschumacher/dividefair)`. Loading the package is done with the usual `library(dividefair)`

## Write down the necessary information in two files
This is the tricky part of the undertaking. You need to have two files where you collect all the information that you need. Fortunately you can use those files also during the planning of the group activity - so next time you start with a group activity write down the information acording to the following scheme. 

> The `participants.csv` file. This should be a csv file. There should be 4 types of columns in that file: person columns (something like *id*, *name* or *age*), grouping columns (usually called *group*), cost columns (that all start with the prefix *cost_* and the continue with the name of the cost) and lastely and adjustment column (called *adjustment*). You can have a look at the example file [participants.csv](inst/participants.csv)

> The `costs.csv` file. This file contains all the costs. One column must be *id*, one column must be the name of the cost and one column should contain the actual cost. You can have a look at the example file [costs.csv](inst/costs.csv)



```{r examples-read_data}
df <- read_data(path = system.file("participants.csv", package = "dividefair"))

```




# Helper functions
We need some helper functions along the way.

## Function to change the categorical values to numerical values 
In the cost variables we accept categorical values. 


```{r examples-change_categorical_to_numeric}
df <- change_categorical_to_numeric()
```





# Get stats

```{r examples-get_stats}
get_stats(read_data())

```




```{r example-divide_costs}
df <- divide_costs()
```
