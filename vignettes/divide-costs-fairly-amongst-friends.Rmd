# This is the documentation of all functions of the package


## Function to read costs file
This is a helper function that reads in the data from the participant file.

```{r example-check_costs}
data_costs <- costsplitter::check_costs()
```





## Function to read the participants file
This is a helper function that reads in the data from the participant file

```{r examples-check_participants}
data_participants <- check_participants()

```




## Function to change the categorical values to numerical values 
This is a helper function that is used in the check_participants function. In the cost variables we accept categorical values. These categorical values need to be turned into numeric values 

```{r examples-cat_to_num}
data_participants = check_participants()
data_participants2 <- cat_to_num(data_participants)
```








## Function to collect some basic stats 
This function collects some basic stats about the activity and the participants

```{r examples-get_stats}
stats <- get_stats(check_participants())

```



## Function to minimize payments between payers and recievers
This is a helper function. We will recieve people who will recieve money and people who will need to pay money. We need to match those by also reducing the number of payments. 

```{r example-minimize_payments}

df <- data.frame(
  person = c("Brown", "Smith", "Fisher", "Taylor", "Davis", "Johnson", "Wilson", "ORally"),
  to_pay = c(-995, -125, -80,  210, 245, 300, 365, 80)
)

minimize_payments(df)

```




## Function to give you amount each has to pay

```{r example-divide_fairly}
result <- divide_fairly(pay_by = "group")
```
